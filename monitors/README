This module creates all resources necessary to automate the enablement of the Azure Network Watcher service.

Current State:  Please note that per official Microsoft documentation (link provided below):

WARNING:
"Opting-out of Network Watcher automatic enablement is a permanent change. Once you opt-out you cannot opt-in without contacting support"

Thus, what we are doing is disabling the automatic enablement so that we can enable it ourselves with our own
naming convention.

The following resources are created in this deployment:

    - Resource Group
    - Network Watcher Service Creation
    - Local-Exec Provisioner to Enable Network Watcher for Subscription

Future State:  Info here
